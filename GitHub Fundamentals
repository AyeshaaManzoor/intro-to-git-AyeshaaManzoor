From this course I have learned the basics of GitHub. 
I understand how Git serves as a distributed Version Control System and how GitHub provides an online platform for collaboration with a user-friendly interface. 
I have learned a workflow that allows for experimentation and collaboration without the risk of losing previous work. 
I have also learned some key terminologies such as Repositories, Branches, Forks, Pull requests, and Issues. 
Repository: It is like a project folder that stores all the files of our project and its history. It allows us to track changes, collaborate with others, and easily go back to our own previous projects if needed.
Fork: It refers to creating our own duplicate of another user's repository. It allows us to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.
Pull request: It is a way to show what we have worked on and ask the project owner to include our changes in the main project. 
Issues: In Git, issues are like virtual sticky notes where we can track tasks, bugs, or make improvements for our own project. 
Branches: In Git, branches are like separate workspaces for our project. They let us to try out new ideas or fix issues without affecting the main project.
In conclusion, I have learned the basics of GitHub from this course very clearly, which will help me to work on this platform more effectively.
